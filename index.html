        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Daniel Awotundun, enrolled at the University of Ottawa.
            I am interested in <a href="https://shorturl.at/fuyGN">human capital multipliers.</a>  
            Individuals are able to iterate quickly using the power of computers to make things like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley"> Stardew Valley</a>,
            and there is a new term for it called
            <a href="https://shorturl.at/flzS6"> "Solopreneur." </a>
            If there is a problem, I prefer to roll up my sleeves and start breaking things. My motto is: <em>[Fail Fast, Fail Forward].</em>
            I also love working with teams but every Championship team must consist of Championship Players.
            I believe that my endeavors and skills can be valuable to a plethora of projects.

            Some example of human capital multipliers are:
            <ul>
                <li>Web Development - An idea or a business just needs a link for a global customer base. </li>
                <hr>
                <li>ChatGPT and other LLMs - Information, skill acquisition, debugging tool, etc.</li>
                <hr>    
                <li>MidJourney/DALL-E - Non-artists are able to communicate ideas using art to tell stories.</li>
                <hr>
                <li>Youtube/Twitter - Information dissemination and community building.</li>
            </ul>

            I think the intersection of all these tools and various APIs makes a powerful and well equipped 
            human in this information age. The possibilities are endless.
            As a result, I have decided to dedicate my time and effort to information dissemination mediums.

        <p>This is a video I made with premiere pro simply messing with keyframes and high resolution images from 
            <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/explore">Midjourney.</a> 
            I just need a script and subtitles and suddenly I have engaging content.
            <h6> I recommend having sound on. </h6>

        <p>I love video editing and youtube because these technologies enable story telling, sharing ideas, and building community.</p>

        <p>This website was created by me with the web development knowledge I have acquired so far.
            If I can prompt AI tools adequately, design illustrious websites, create interesting videos while telling a compelling story, 
            I believe I can guarantee positive outcomes. I also hope to dive deeper into computer engineering down the line.</p>

        <p>Other than this passion of mine which is a multi-faceted and time consuming endeavor, I lift weights, 
            play soccer and cook to alleviate the health costs of being a modern human.</p>
